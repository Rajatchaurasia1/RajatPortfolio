Most often we hear the appreciation of a walk in the morning, but the real significance and value of a walk in the moonlit night are not commonly realized.

I, however, am in the habit of having a stroll after dinner. Sometimes, it is a dark night and sometimes a moonlit night. But I never miss this brief stroll in the park outside my house. The charm of this stroll is enhanced if it is a moonlit night.

Last night was a full moon night. After taking dinner, I went out of my house. The cool silvery moonlight simply fascinated me. The glorious moon was shining in the sky and accompanied by the twinkling stars that looked like little fairies it seemed to be a good companion, perhaps more lovable and reliable than a human companion.


 
My own shadow in the moonlight seemed to me just my own self or soul walking along with me. The shadows of trees on the roadside offered to me the hidden idea of giants about which I had read in old storybooks.

I went to the park. The water of the fountain in the park glistened all the more in the silvery moonlight. The leaves on the trees looked like shining gold coins silver. The human beings walking in the streets and in the park all seemed to be strange creatures from some other world.

I sat down on a bench in the park for some time and meditated. It seemed to me that I was going to have some mystic experience. My mind was calm and all tension and worries had fled from my mind. 

After some time, I returned home. I was full of peace, love, joy and all that makes life worth living.<br><br>
Walking is always good for the human body. Be it them a morning walk or a moonlight walk.

Unlike a morning walk which is important for the physical and mental state of a person, a moonlit walk is more important for the emotional and spiritual wellbeing of a human being.


 
Poets and writers have written numerous words about the wondrous effect a moonlit night has on the soul of the human being. They have created situations of romance and tragedy under the moonlight. Many heroes and heroines have pledged their eternal love for each other on these nights.

For a reader of classic literature, a walk in the moonlight is a must to experience the magic that is woven by the pristine rays of the moon on the human heart.

The ideal time to go for a moonlit walk is during the summer months when the breeze is cool and the night air is full of the chirping of cicadas. The ideal place is either a sea-beach or a flower, filled park.

As you walk on the dew-wet grass, you will feel the hypnotism of the moon. The cool air will soothe your tensions away. Your body will feel light as air. The fragrance of flowers or the muted roars of the sea waves will transfer you into a different land. This will be a land where there are no problems of survival in the world. Here you will feel in harmony with nature

For those who are not romantically inclined, a moonlit night is the best venue to refresh their bodies with the cool moonlight and a brisk walk. It helps in the digestion of the food. It eases the body of all its tiredness and makes sleeping easy. It makes a person feel refreshed in the morning.

Moonlit walks have both poetic and scientific importance. Ancient texts have suggested that they are always beneficial to the person who takes them.
